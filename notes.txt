Title:

Al-Driven Patient Symptom Triage and Follow-up Planner for Healthcare

Problem Statement:

Healthcare providers deal with high volumes of patient inquiries and symptom reports, making efficient triage and follow-up planning difficult. Manual processes lead to delays and inconsistent recommendations. A generative Al agent that can interactively assess patient symptoms, suggest triage levels, and generate personalized follow-up plans by integrating electronic health record (EHR) mock data and medical knowledge bases can streamline workflows. The system must ensure data privacy, multi-agent collaboration, and user-friendly interfaces.

Data Requirements:

De-identified patient symptom records (mock data), sample EHR data sets, access to medical knowledge APIs (e.g., MedlinePlus), user authentication data, and pretrained LLM models.

(Feel free to generate synthetic data as well from the provided access)

Expected Output:

A A production-ready app enabling interactive symptom triage via Al, with personalized follow-up plans linked to patient records. Features include secure login, clinician dashboards, multi-agent coordination, error handling for API calls, full documentation, test coverage, and performance metrics.
